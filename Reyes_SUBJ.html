	<h3 style="color:#660000">Foundation</h3>
		<p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top:-15px">
			Folksonomies are the result of social tagging, "the practice of publicly labeling or categorizing resources in a shared, on-line environment" <!--7--> (Trant 1). 
			These collections have become increasingly more common, but where does this leave controlled vocabularies?
			In order to properly make this assessment, let us take into consideration the emergent vocabulary my classmates and I came up with over the duration of this course. 
			We have created a folksonomy of library related information, including metadata application profiles, linked data, controlled vocabulary, subject access, and much more.
			Consequently, we must examine our tag list and compare it to established controlled vocabularies and subject access systems.

    <h3 style="color:#660000">Controlled Vocabulary</h3>
		<p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top:-15px; margin-bottom: -10px">
			In order to compare a folksonomy to a controlled vocabulary, we must first understand its definition. 
			Joudrey and Taylor state that a controlled vocabulary is a list or database of terms representing a concept which are brought together in order to be used to populate a metadata element <!--1--> (476).
			In non-technical language, it is a bunch of words or phrases about a topic that helps people find something in that topic.
			The main difference between a controlled vocabulary and a folksonomy is the types of words or phrases that can be used. 
			Folksonomies can literally be any word or phrase that the creator of the tag decides best describes the material. 
			On the other hand, a controlled vocabulary has a set dictionary of preferred terms that can be used so as to maintain consistency between capitalization, pluralization, punctuation, and spelling differences.
			In our folksonomy, this was a major challenge since many times tags were repeated due to these issues. For example, there are three different tags for cataloging: "Cataloging," "cataloging" and "Cataloguing."
			Another good thing about controlled vocabularies are the relationships among terms which act as alternatives and can be cross-referenced to each other <!--1--> (Joudrey and Taylor 477).
			This feature would have been great in our folksonomy, instead of looking through all the tags and figuring out which ones are similar, if we click on one, the others would automatically appear as a cross-reference.
			For example, if I wanted to figure out how many tags were about Folksonomies, I would also need to check folksonomy, Folksonomy, Folksonomy (user-generated metadata), social tagging system, user-generated metadata, 
			and more. Though controlled vocabularies seems to be more organized at this point, folksonomies do have some good points.

			Based on a study described in <!--3--> Manzo et al., on average, users were able to find images six times faster when they used user-generated classification system versus a controlled vocabulary.
			I believe this is partly due to the fact that the language and vocabulary people use daily is not the same vocabulary that exists in many controlled vocabularies.
			A great example of this is in Kakali et al., where it states "the subject heading 'cyborgs' was substituted for the subject heading 'human body — social aspects'" <!--2--> (200).
			If I were being completely honest, if I were not a cataloger, I would never think to look for information about cyborgs under the heading human body social aspects. 
			This is just one example of many in which everyday patrons would not be able to find what they are looking for because they do not know the correct terminology.
			<!--8--> Vander Wal states that "the value in this external tagging is derived from people using their own vocabulary and adding explicit meaning, which may come from inferred understanding of the information/object."
			I understand that the hierarchical relationships in controlled vocabularies eventually will help the user find what they are looking for, even though they do not know the correct terminology, 
			but it will take them more time to do so.
			I believe the same as Joudrey and Taylor when they say "information professionals will need to find inexpensive ways of taking advantage of all of this user-generated metadata to supplement, augment, 
			and enhance the expert-created subject metadata in the form of controlled vocabulary terms and classification notations" <!--1--> (528).

	<h3 style="color:#660000">Subject Access</h3>
		<p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top:-15px; margin-bottom: -10px">
			<!--6--> Spiteri mentions that folksonomy tags perform four main functions, these include identifying an item's: subject; format (for example, blog); ownership; and characteristics (for example, funny) (15).
			When we created our folksonomy, our tags were allowed to be terms that both described what the item is and what the item is about. There were no limitations or rules binding our tags.
			<!--4--> Mathes adds one more function to the list, communication. 
			He argues that a tag can be a communicative tool because only by tagging an item with a specific tag phrase like "sometaithurts" (so meta it hurts) could a user then join the conversation. 
			"Conversely," he says, "the only way to follow the conversation was through the systems automated collocating of like tagged items."
			This is comparable to the hashtags people use on social media. Nowadays everything has a hashtag; concerts, webinars, events, places, departments, holidays, and so much more all have hashtags.
			If our folksonomy were to have this feature of being able to collocate like tagged items, it would work better; but as is, it is not a very efficient list. It is very messy and has no organization whatsoever.
			Though there are some faults with established subject access systems like the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), our folksonomy cannot hold a candle to it.
		<!--216 words--></p>
		<p style="text-indent: 25px">	
			The main flaw in LCSH is that is cannot adequately describe newer realia and digital items such as video games.
			<!--9--> Welhouse says it best when he mentions that catalog records rarely have "information about a work's content... [since] systems tend to focus on providing descriptive information such as platform, title, 
			publisher, and price... [and] although lists of styles, concepts, or subject headings may occasionally be found in some systems, 
			they are also undefined or inconsistently used which makes it difficult for users to effectively use such metadata to search or browse games."
			To aid in this flaw, <!--5--> the Online Audiovisual Catalogers (OLAC Inc.) introduced their OLAC Video Game Genre Vocabulary (OLACVGGV) which includes sixty-six genre terms. 
			Each term has "a scope note to help librarians choose the correct term when cataloging video games, [and] the vocabulary is fully cross-referenced and includes authoritative sources 
			to corroborate the usage of the genre term as applied to video games" (OLAC Inc.)
			Since, I believe, the main problem with LCSH is their user-friendliness, merging a folksonomy with LCSH would solve this issue. Seeing that folksonomies are "a conflation of the worlds 'folk' and 'taxonomy' 
			used to refer to an informal, organic assemblage of related terminology," it would be the perfect addition to LCSH as long as they are managed <!--7--> (Trant 1).

	<h3 style="color:#660000">Resolution</h3>
		<p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top:-15px">
			I do believe that a controlled vocabulary is needed, however I also believe it can be improved. 
			It may take a lot of time and resources to achieve, but I believe that a merged controlled vocabulary and folksonomy will change the way people search and find what they need.
			This would increase user-friendliness and make items easier to find by cross-reference user-generated tags to the controlled vocabulary.
			I realize this is a very optimistic and Utopian view; but if libraries do not change with the times, they will fade along the way. 
			However, in my experience, libraries have been the most versatile institution in history and I do not see that changing any time soon.
